### Ensuring Proper Shell Completions for Commands Managed by 1Password’s CLI

If you're using 1Password's CLI (`op`) to manage commands like the GitHub CLI (`gh`) and Homebrew (`brew`), you might have encountered issues with shell completions. By default, `op` creates aliases for these commands, which can break shell completions. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to fix this issue by using shell functions instead of aliases.

#### The Problem

1Password’s CLI creates aliases for commands it manages, such as `brew` and `gh`. However, these aliases can disrupt shell completions. While `setopt completealiases` can restore completions for full command names, it breaks completions for shorthand aliases like `br=brew`.

#### The Solution

Replace the aliases created by `op` with shell functions. This approach maintains proper shell completions without needing `setopt completealiases`.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

**1. Identify the Commands Managed by `op`**

First, identify the commands that 1Password’s CLI manages. For example, `brew` and `gh`.

**2. Edit the `~/.config/op/plugins.sh` File**

Replace the aliases in `~/.config/op/plugins.sh` with shell functions. Here’s an example configuration:

```sh
export OP_PLUGIN_ALIASES_SOURCED=1

# Function for GitHub CLI tool
gh() {
    op plugin run -- gh "$@"
}

# Function for Homebrew
brew() {
    op plugin run -- brew "$@"
}

# Add other command functions managed by 1Password's CLI as needed
# Example for another tool, replace 'tool' with actual command
tool() {
    op plugin run -- tool "$@"
}

# Repeat the pattern above for all other commands managed by `op`
```

**3. Reload Your Shell Configuration**

After making these changes, reload your shell configuration:

```sh
source ~/.config/op/plugins.sh
source ~/.zshrc
```

**4. Verify Shell Completions**

Check if the shell completions work as expected by using tab completion with the commands:

```sh
gh [TAB]
brew [TAB]
```

#### Benefits of Using Shell Functions

- **Retains Shell Completions**: Functions allow the shell to use the completions of the original command.
- **Avoids Completealiases Issues**: You don’t need to use `setopt completealiases`, which can cause problems with shorthand aliases.
- **Flexibility**: You can easily add more functions for other commands managed by `op`.

### Conclusion

By using shell functions instead of aliases, you can ensure proper shell completions for commands managed by 1Password’s CLI. This approach provides a smooth and efficient command-line experience, allowing you to take full advantage of both `op` and the powerful features of your shell.
